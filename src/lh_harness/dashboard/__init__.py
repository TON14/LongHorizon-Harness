"""Self-contained dashboard for LongHorizon-Harness.

Everything the dashboard needs lives in this package. The rest of the harness
only touches the small public surface below:

* :func:`start_dashboard`: launch the web server in a background thread.
* :func:`make_human_hook`: build the human-in-the-loop hook (round + end gates).
* :class:`DashboardState` / :class:`ApprovalRules`: shared state and rules.
